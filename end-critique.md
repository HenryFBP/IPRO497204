# Course Critique

## Instructors

-1/5

Our instructors constantly change requirements, provide conflicting feedback, and slight us during presentations.

Mancini and Kaplan both are unnecessarily rude and criticize small aspects of presentations to the point of completely stopping presentations to add slide numbers.

Our group has been frequently under fire for not implementing requirements such as weekly slideshows that were never explicitly communicated to us as requirements.

I have been told multiple times that "We are not trying hard enough" and other discouraging statements, when this course's material is both out of my major and I work a 40-hr-a-week job.
In short, I would say my experience has been very negative and I feel demotivated in class. I just want this class to finish as soon as possible so that I don't have to be under my instructors' gaze.

## Course

4/5

I think that this course provides a large amount of opportunities for really any major to find something useful to do in. As an ITM major, I learned a lot about GPU programming, concurrency, memory allocation, and physics concepts in this IPRO.

This course is probably the most interdisciplinary course I've ever taken, and it is very free-form in the work that one person can do.
